**Before submitting:**
- [ ] I've read [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) to check if this is already planned
- [ ] I've read [PHILOSOPHY.md](../../PHILOSOPHY.md) to understand project scope
- [ ] This feature aligns with the "solve one problem well" principle
- [ ] This feature doesn't violate the "no bloat" principle (no cloud, no accounts, no telemetry)

**Note:** Features that violate the project philosophy will be closed without implementation. This is intentional—focused tools stay useful by saying "no" to feature creep.
